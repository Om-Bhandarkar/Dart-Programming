<h1>Getter and Setter</h1>

<li><strong>Private Variables</strong></li>

When you define a property for a class, you can access it from the outside of a class. The accessibility of the property is public.

To make the property private, you need to prefix its name with an underscore (__):

Syntax :
    type_variableName;

<li><strong>Setter Getter</strong></li>
<p>
A combination of the getter and the setter methods are used to transform and/or encapsulate instance variables. In Dart, the getter is an instance method specified by get keyword. This method does not take any arguments, hence it does not contain parentheses (). While the setter method is specified by set keyword which receives value to be set as an argument.
</p>
A getter function is called when it is accessed like an instance variable on the object.
<br>
A setter function is called when a value is assigned to object with the same variable name..

We use 'get' keyword to define a 'getter' function.

We use 'set' keyword to define a 'setter' function.
